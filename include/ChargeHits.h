/// This class implements a 3D hit finder using ROOT's TSpectrum class for peak finding and a constant fraction
/// discrimination for timing. As input it needs a viperData object containing the raw data and a viperMap object for
/// the pixel and ROI coordinates. The parameters for the peak finder of the TSpectrum instance can be set by the user.
/// The timing works by finding the first and the last sample of the pixel and ROI pulses by means of a constant
/// fraction of the peak value of the pulse. The fraction can be set independently for pixel and ROIs and start and end
/// of the pulse, respectively. After this, the found pixel pulses are searched for overlaps with ROI pulses and all
/// matches are written to both a vector that contains the indices of all matched ROI pulses for a pixel pulse and vice
/// versa. Besides, the raw pulse, its integral and 3D hit candidates are calculated. All the data is stored in a vector
/// containing one viperEvent struct per event. They can be accessed by const reference or by reference.
