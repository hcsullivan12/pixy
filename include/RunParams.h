/// This class contains all the maps required for the VIPER pixel readout reconstruction.
/// Namely, the map from DAQ channels to readout channels and vice versa, and the mechanical coordinates of the pixels
/// and the regions of interest (ROI). It is instantiated with the run ID based on which it will generate the
/// corresponding maps. All the getter methods are const and thus an instance of this class can be passed by const
/// reference to other objects requiring it. DAQ channels are numbered from 0 to 63 with channels 0 through 31
/// corresponding to the "Ind_x" histogram in the raw data and channels 32 through 63 corresponding to the "Col_x"
/// histogram in the raw data. Caution has to be applied not to confuse those with the actual pixel collection channels
/// and ROI induction channels as the naming of the histograms is hardcoded in the DAQ driver. Additionally, this class
/// also stores all the run parameters necessary for reconstruction such as calibration constants.
